# Dynamic planar convex hull.
This repository contains header libraries implementing real time dynamic planar convex hull algorithms.

## Online setting
In the online setting, we have a stream of point insertion queries, and the objective is to quickly rebuild
the hull and discard any points trapped in the interior of the new hull.

This implementation is optimal in the sense that all queries take logarithmic time.
It was part of a term project in Computational Geometry, IIT Kharagpur Spring 2020.

An interface exists to answer point location queries, extremal direction queries, and tangent queries.
All these operations are performed in expected O(log(n)) time.
The expected time complexity comes from the fact that a randomised binary search tree ("treap") has been used for simplicity of implementation.
But in real life it's practically logarithmic as noted in the performance testing IPython notebook.

This implementation uses an idea presented in [1] of storing enough information in the tree node itself to guide the binary search,
but simplifies some of the case analysis by maintaining two sequences (and hence trees) corresponding to the "lower hull" and the
"upper hull" of the set of points inserted into the hull. See implementation reference (part of our term paper) attached in notes/online for details.

## Fully dynamic setting.
In the online setting, we have a stream of point insertion and deletion queries, and the objective is to quickly rebuild
the hull without discarding any of the points in the interior.
Notably there exist real time algorithms with logarithmic complexity, but they tend to have bad constants in practice.

This implementation uses ideas presented in the book [2] and the [3] and answers queries in a time proportional to the square of the logarithm
of the total number of points, regardless of the size of the hull.
Please see the notebook in notes/dynamic for performace tests.
